TODO:
Cap C4 should be ceramic not electrolytic.
0.6mm track width does not allow for current pad thickness on pin headers, either change supplier or pin headers.
Seperate labeled pins for voltage in and ground? danger of getting it wrong although the square marked pin headers are all grounds.
Make sure those pots we have match the holes on the board before commiting to fab house.
Add option to surface mount decoupling cap onto pin 7?  
Spread out components and add labels to make a soldering kit (50mmx50mm board) otherwise this 33mmx33mm board should suffice.
